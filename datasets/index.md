# Datasets

C2SM provides different climate datasets such as CMIP5, CMIP6 or CORDEX, as downloaded from the original sources, as well as processed datasets such as the so-called CMIP6-NextGeneration (CMIP6-ng) archive. 

If you need access to other climate datasets contact us at [support@c2sm.ethz.ch](mailto:support@c2sm.ethz.ch) or add an [issue](https://github.com/C2SM/Tasks-Support/issues) and we will try to help.
