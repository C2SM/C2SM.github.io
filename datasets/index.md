# Datasets

C2SM provides a number of datasets (see below). In addition, the Forest Ecology group has put together information about commonly used datasets and how to use them here.

We provide different climate datasets such as CMIP5, CMIP6 or CORDEX, as downloaded from the original sources, as well as processed datasets such as the so-called CMIP6-NextGeneration (CMIP6-ng) archive. 
If you need access to other climate datasets contact us at support@c2sm.ethz.ch or add an issue to https://github.com/C2SM/Tasks-Support and we will try to help.
