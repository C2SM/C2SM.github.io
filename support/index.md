# User Support

User Support refers to C2SM's efforts to ensure that all supported software runs correctly on supported computer systems. This includes hosting the software for easy distribution to members, regularly testing the supported software, and helping members resolve issues with running and compiling the software. Find information about supported [tools](https://c2sm.github.io/tools/) and [models](https://c2sm.github.io/models/) in the corresponding sections.

## Request support

To request regular support, please [use our discussion forum](https://github.com/C2SM/Tasks-Support/discussions/categories/support). The C2SM core team will be notified and will try to respond as soon as possible. In addition, all C2SM members can participate in these discussions and help as well.
