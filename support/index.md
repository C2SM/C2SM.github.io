# User Support

User Support refers to the Core Team's efforts to ensure that all supported software runs correctly on supported computer systems. This includes hosting the software for easy distribution to members, regular testing and helping members resolve issues with running and compiling. Find information about supported [tools](https://c2sm.github.io/tools/) and [models](https://c2sm.github.io/models/) in the corresponding sections.

## Request support

If you do not have access to the support forum, please follow the instructions under [How to get Access](https://c2sm.github.io/#how-to-get-access).
