# Center for Climate Systems Modeling (C2SM)

**Welcome to the C2SM User Landing Page!**

Here we collect helpful information for scientists and partners
about the C2SM core team, tasks, support, models, tools, datasets
and much more.

Whether you are seeking a quick overview or in-depth details on a specific topic,
this website is your comprehensive resource. 
For additional information on specific projects, we have provided direct links,
(not clear to me what it means: such as to documentation that we distribute directly with the code.)

## Core Team

The C2SM Core Team - or C2SM's Executive Office - currently employs six scientific programmers. Their work is distributed among the following areas:

- Tasks from the Working Groups
- Maintenance of supported models, tools and datasets
- Regular support for users
- EXCLAIM project
- Organization of workshops
