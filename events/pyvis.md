# Python Visualization Course
C2SM offers an annual Visulization Course as part of our [technical training](https://c2sm.ethz.ch/education/technical-training.html).
Two day course targets Python beginners. Most examples and exercises shown in the course are drawn from the field of Climate Research.
We place particular emphasis on the visualization of unstructured grids through the use of [icon-vis](https://github.com/C2SM/icon-vis/tree/master).
