# Python Visualisation Course
C2SM offers an annual programming course for visulisation in Python as part of our [technical training](https://c2sm.ethz.ch/education/technical-training.html).
Two day course targets Python beginners. Most examples and exercises shown in the course are drawn from the field of climate research.
We place particular emphasis on the visualisation of unstructured grids through the use of [icon-vis](https://github.com/C2SM/icon-vis/tree/master).
