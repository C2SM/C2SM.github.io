C2SM organizes events such as the [quarterly ICON meeting](https://c2sm.github.io/events/icon_meeting.html), [Git workshops for beginners and advanced users](https://c2sm.ethz.ch/education/technical-training.html) and [ETH Klimarunde](https://c2sm.ethz.ch/events.html).

We are also involved in organizing the Swiss Climate Summer School and we assist SIS (ETH Scientific IT Services) in Python programming and scientific visualization workshops.
