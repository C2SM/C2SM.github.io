## Reports

### C2SM (Michael Jähn, Annika Lauber, Matthieu Leclair)
MJ welcomes everyone and shares the [latest news about ICON from C2SM]().

Questions about bug

### Sylvaine Ferrachat
phd student Andrina is going to study trop. cyclone with iconham at high resolution 10km and below. setting up this type of exp. Successful to run 10km global for a few time step. Upgrade icon base version (2.6.4), want to go to open source.

### Andrea Stenke
icon-art on euler. thanks to Tina and Urs also as account on cscs to access data pool. thanks to Mcihael managed to implement own script to precessing chain tool on euler. had to learn that latest version doesnt support amip runs anymore

### Arash Hamzehloo
arsynic implementing into icon-art. After that will implement emissions

### Emmanuele Russo
focusing on developing an aqua planet with dry atmosphere. icon-clm: for the setup for eurocordex they are still working on definite setup. Issue with short wave radiation. Managed to reduce bias - basically increasing cloud cover everwhere. Code changes are necessary, will need to do merging into main branch of icon. Want to have definite setup end of april.
ER thinks that we might need to port the changes to GPU.
DB asks about the project
ER: project to propose optimal. clm stands for ... (not for climate land model)
DB asks if we want to use same setup
MJ: yes should basically the same but running it on GPU
DB: is this also why the transient aerosols are importan
MJ: yes, problem with climaologial aerosols showed bias. It's rel. old, so not representativ for now.

### Fulden Batibeniz
plan is to run eurocordex with seasonal forecast and waiting for final version. 
DB asks about group
FB is the person to transition ICON to the group

### Will Sawyer
new alps system is arriving, prepared virtual cluster as a sandbox. numerous technical problems. machine frequently goes down and gets down. Hopefully this will be resolved until we get access.
ICON is one of the main application they are testing on pre-alps system
shows slides: peeking at how we are currently doing with icon on (pre)alps. 85 simulated days per day with 5km resolution. r2b8/r2b9. They can run now on really large
Comparing Daint and Santis: Speedup of a factor of 6 (a bit less than expected). New GPUs have much more memory, so it's not fair comparision, so GPUs are not filled up.
Doing a fair comparison: factor of 9
icon-dsl has roughly the same performance but not a disappointment. Happy it's running.
Running same simulation on CPUs: very powerful. One Grace has 72 cores. Fanomanoul cpu performance. Ocean will be running on CPU.
ML: ocean was running on cpu in the setup
WS: correct
ML: cpu on the same node?
WS: yes
DB: how easy is i to find proper config with nproma and stuff, which runs efficiently on GH. Will there be a recipe?
WS: for the dsl version (can only calculate wih one block). nproma should be as large as possible but here are memory constraints. MAximum is what still fits on one GPU. They will give recipe for GPU version, can also do that for CPU (optimal nproma seems to be 48)
MA: asks what reported speedup of 1.4 reported by Xavier means
WS: that's with respect to Balfrin.
MJ: asks about slides
WS: needs one week (slides immediately)
MS: comparison Balfrin - Alps convection is 2 times slower
WS: there are some issues, could be numerical, could also be memory issue. That's why they want more time.

### Christian Steger
will work on the physics of icon. will look at interaction topography, surface radiation.

### Alina Yapparova 
just joined MCH, was at earth scienteist before. GLORY project, will work with 3D radiation data

### Marco Arpagaus
icon-22. still struggling with machine that gets booted every other day. struggling more with the downsides of alps. Still working on open issues. Model is still performing well. They run pre-operational. No bad surprises so far. ICon is better in almost every aspect. few systematic biases which are larger. Most prominant is 2m temperature. Too much radiation. Have a few ideas about how to improve temperature issue but will not be operational immediately. They do post-processing to improve forecast and it typically removes bias, so removing bias beforehand will destroy statistic for post-processing. Therefore, they cannot solve issues immediately. Current date for going operational is May.
DB: what are the ideas about 2m temperature
MA: periods did not have proper snow analysis. Not yet using radiation shading. Helps for valleys. Minimum diffusion coefficient allows stronger stabilization in winter time.
ES: what is your config based on which you will use on ERA5
MA: C2SM runs

### Arash Hamzehloo
worsk on porting art components to GPU. Open MR. working on adding addiational functionality. want to compare to data from satellite

### Clarissa Kroll
plan is to settuing up and running air quality simulation. recently added full chemistry case to processing chain. runs iconart with full chemistry. Case assumes that chemistry mechanism is implemented, wants to change that.
MJ offers to contact him for precessing chain.
CK: when it comes to implementaiton

### Michael Steiner
uses iconart with many passive tracers. no big problems so far, runs smoothly

### Kutay Dönmez
working on inegrating something in icon. resolve something on urban climate.
DB: corine land 

### Mikael Stellio
added infrastructure from exclaim. ported five loops in ham. currently working on tsa, easier to use gt4py there. No problems for once.
