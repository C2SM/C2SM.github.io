## Reports

### C2SM (Michael Jähn, Annika Lauber, Jonas Jucker, Matthieu Leclair)

MJ welcomes all the participants to the meeting and presents the [news from C2SM about ICON](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/WF4JiBulij5UqXF/download?path=%2F2023-09-26&files=ICON_Meeting_2023_09_26.pdf).

### Discussion about presented results of the speed-up of the two-moment microphysics scheme after EuroHack23

MA asks what the difference is between the implicit and the explicit scheme.
AL answers that the implicit scheme depends on the status of the next timestep and the current time, while the explicit scheme does not. 

WS asks if it is a fair to compare the timings of the explicit scheme with the implicit scheme. He reports on behalf of Anurag Dipankar that he is worried about stability issues with the explicit scheme.

JJ answers that those are preliminary results and it's not a totally fair comparion. He suggests to have scientific work, e.g. a master thesis for comparing the explicit and implicit scheme.

### Fulden Batibeniz
FB started working for Uni Bern who want to start using ICON. She is doing regional climate modelling and plans to use the seasonal forcast of ECMWF for extreme events running with many ensembles.

### Clarissa Kroll
CK is working with R2B10, running it on an uncoupled setting. She is currently doing benchmarking.

### Jakopo Canton
JC doesn’t use ICON yet but wants to start with another LES code, running ICON on very high solution.

### Doris Folini
DF reports on behalf of Boriana Chtirkova who uses ICON with ECHAM physics. She is looking at SST patterns and their impact on internal variabiality on other variables.

### Emmanuelle Russo
use icon to investigate drivers for heatwaves. Uses icon with echam physics. Doing idealized runs. 

### Stefan Rüdisühli
helping out GB. solving a 300k warm biasis. Inconsistancies in training data. trying to get better training data. 

### Guillaume Bertoli
2 new tools for ml emulation of the radiation in icon. huge temperature error at the top as soon as switching to NN. Pressure interval at surface and top layers. It is 10^4 higher at top. icon goes so high in atmosphere because dumping layer is needed. maybe they should not be accurate but it should work. not sure how to do that yet. pressure interval may be reason why it explodes

### Jan Zibell
aquaplanet ensemble to study storm stracks an dthe roll of latent heat releases. Computing budgets

### Nadja Omanovic
uses 2mom scheme. running icon in les mode to improve precip forecast
WS asks if it’s the same scheme.

### Andrea Stenke
uses icon-art for simulation of atm cycling of different trace elements. working on aersol uptake. art documentation not very comprehensive. progress is slow as only two people

### Clarissa Kroll
empa. projekt using icon-art for air quality simulation in europe and switzerland. running full chemistry simulations capture formation of ozone or other air pollutions. learning about aerosol modelling

### Arash Hamzehloo
porting icon-art to gpus. Almost finished one of the submodules for immersed modelling of imemersed gasses like methan. want to make code ready for gpus for more complex parts

### Katrin Ehlert
scientific coordinator just started.

### Mikael Stellio
working in icon-ham. optimizing for gpus. missing interface with icon-ham and rtmgp (radiation scheme) now included and ported. next step to test iocon-hma with different resolutions. hope that going with high resolution helps us for next steps

### Marco Arpagaus
new names at MCH. report on status on icon-22, which is exhcaning the engines of numericla weather predicitons. replacing cosmo with icon. ongoing for quite a while. reacing milestone to go preoperational next Monday. testing if system is technical robust on new machine (not yet convinced). icon proves to be a good model so far. model close to preoperations version. get increased score. can concistently improve score for wind, clouds, precip and temperature?
there are seasons where icon is consistantly worse. there is a systematic biasis (2m temperature and globe radiation). So not everything gets better. But confident that icon will be better than cosmo.
ER: biasis in temp and rad: positiv or negativ=
MA: yes it’s too warm especially in the valley by 1C or more. prob cooling not efficient enough during night. Bias not on mountain tops. strong biasis in morning and evening (radiation). Wind is too low on mountain tops (not sure). Send me a mail so I can send you the plots.
ER: in icon-clm there are some biasis in temp in radiation which are counter-intuitive. Maybe same issue

Nachtrag: MA: understimation of wind. Not only valley wind.

### William Sawyer
supoosed to keep overview what is cgoing on in icon-world as icon is very important. Two other icon related works on EH23. one on ocean, which had a lot of success. looking so good that I could suggest to run icon coupled ocean-atmosphere. Tried to put in different solver, which wanst entirly successful. Other project: icon-art ported parts of atm chemistry of art. Results were very good. Very difficult code. Fortran 2008 features hard to port. They had a speed-up which was 20 times better than the cpu speed-up Will was working on.
From Anurag about EXCLAIM effort. They support icon-atmosphere to python framework, which is a big project. Anurag is trying to run within first version rtb9. Getting first benchmark, after a few month model explodes.
New ALPS platform which will affect a lot of people. Should be fully operational about February next year. First tests with ICON on alps looks very good performance wise. very promising. transisting always a bit dramatic. support there from c2sm and cscs.

### Brigitta Goger
intrersted in moutain boundary layer. High resolution over alps going down to 500/250m. tets both turbulence schemes. testing if higher resolution improve model. not an easy answer. Some things better, some not.

### Chia Rui Ong
porting graupel scheme with gt4py version.
