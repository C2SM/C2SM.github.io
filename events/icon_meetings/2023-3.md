## Reports

### C2SM (Michael Jähn, Annika Lauber, Jonas Jucker, Matthieu Leclair)

MJ welcomes all the participants to the meeting and presents the [news from C2SM about ICON](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/WF4JiBulij5UqXF/download?path=%2F2023-09-26&files=ICON_Meeting_2023_09_26.pdf).

### Discussion about presented results of the speed-up of the two-moment microphysics scheme after EuroHack23

MA asks what the difference is between the implicit and the explicit scheme.
AL answers that the implicit scheme depends on the status of the next timestep and the current time, while the explicit scheme does not. 

WS asks if it is a fair to compare the timings of the explicit scheme with the implicit scheme. He reports on behalf of Anurag Dipankar that he is worried about stability issues with the explicit scheme.

JJ answers that those are preliminary results and it's not a totally fair comparion. He suggests to have scientific work, e.g. a master thesis for comparing the explicit and implicit scheme.

### Fulden Batibeniz
FB started working for Uni Bern who want to start using ICON. She is doing regional climate modelling and plans to use the seasonal forcast of ECMWF for extreme events running with many ensembles.

### Clarissa Kroll
ClK is working with R2B10, running it on an uncoupled setting. She is currently doing benchmarking.

### Jakopo Canton
JC doesn’t use ICON yet but wants to start with another LES code, running ICON on very high solution.

### Doris Folini
DF reports on behalf of Boriana Chtirkova who uses ICON with ECHAM physics. She is looking at SST patterns and their impact on internal variabiality on other variables.

### Emmanuelle Russo
ER uses ICON with ECHAM physics to investigate drivers for heatwaves.

### Stefan Rüdisühli
SR is helping out GB in solving a 300K warming bias of their machine learning algorithm. There are inconsistancies in the training data, which is why they are trying to get better training data. 

### Guillaume Bertoli
GB is working on two new tools for machine learning emulation of the radiation in ICON. There is a huge temperature error at the top as soon as switching to the neural network. The cause may be the pressure interval at surface and top layers, which is 10^4 higher at the top. ICON goes so high in the atmosphere because a dumping layer is needed.

### Jan Zibell
JZ is working with an aquaplanet ensemble to study storm stracks and the roll of latent heat releases.

### Nadja Omanovic
NO is using the two-moment microphysics scheme. The goal is to run ICON in LES code to improve the precipitation forcast.
WS asks if it’s the same scheme as has been presented by the C2SM core team.
NO confirms that she is using the same scheme.

### Andrea Stenke
AS uses ICON-ART for simulation of atmospheric cycling of different trace elements. She is working on aersol uptake. Unfortunately, the ART documentation not very comprehensive. The progress is slow as they are only two people working on it.

### Corina Keller
CoK is working at Empa. In their project they are using ICON-ART for air quality simulation in Europe and Switzerland. She is running full chemistry simulations to capture the formation of ozone or other air pollutions.

### Arash Hamzehloo
AH is working on the port ICON-ART to GPUs. They are almost finished with one of the submodules for immersed modelling of immersed gasses like methan. They want to make code ready for GPUs for more complex parts of the code.

### Katrin Ehlert
KE just started as the scientific coordinator for Numerical Weather Prediction at MeteoSwiss.

### Mikael Stellio
MS is working on optimizing ICON-HAM for GPUs. A missing interface with ICON-HAM and rtmp (radiation scheme) is now included and ported. The next step is to test ICON-HAM with different resolutions.

### Marco Arpagaus
MA reports on status on ICON-22, which is exchaning the engines of numerrical weather predictionss. They are reaching the milestone to go pre-operational next Monday. They are testing if the system is technical robust on the new machine (not yet convinced). ICON proves to be a good model so far. It can concistently improve the score for wind, clouds, precipation and temperature. However, there are seasons where ICON is consistantly worse. There is a systematic bias with the 2m temperature and the globe radiation. So not everything gets better. Overall confident that ICON will be better than COSMO.
ER asks if the biases in temperature and radiation are positiv.
MA reponds that yes, it’s too warm especially in the valley by 1C or more. Probably the cooling is not efficient enough during night. The bias is not existing on mountain tops. There are strong biasis in morning and evening in the radiation. The wind is too low on mountain tops and in the valleys. MA can send plots on request.
ER says that in ICON-CLM there are some biasis in temperature and radiation which are counter-intuitive and wonders if the issues are related.

### William Sawyer
WS is working for CSCS and supposed to keep the overview over what is going on in the ICON world. He mentions two other ICON related works at the EuroHack23 (apart from the two-moment microphysics scheme). One of the projects is about the ocean, which had a lot of success. It is actually looking so good that WS could suggest to run ICON in a coupled ocean-atmosphere version. The other project was about ICON-ART where they ported parts of atmospheric chemistry to GPUs. Results were very good but the code included Fortran 2008 features, which are difficult to port to GPUs. They had a speed-up which was 20 times better than the CPU speed-up, where WS was working on.
On behalf of Anurag Dipankar, WS also reports about the EXCLAIM effort. Anurag Dipankar is trying to run with the first version using R2b9 but the model explodes after a few months.
The ALPS platform should be fully operational about February next year. First tests with ICON on ALPS looks very good performance wise but transisting  to a new machine is always a bit dramatic. Users will get support from C2SM and CSCS.

### Brigitta Goger
BG is interested in the moutain boundary layer. She uses high resolution over the alps going down to 500m/250m using both turbulence schemes. BG is testing if higher resolutions improve model. It seems like some things are better but others not.

### Chia Rui Ong
CRO is porting the graupel scheme with GT4Py version.
