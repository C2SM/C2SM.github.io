## Reports

### C2SM (Michael Jähn, Annika Lauber, Matthieu Leclair, Jonas Jucker)
MJ welcomes everyone and shares the [latest news about ICON from C2SM](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/4fXixLycOwOy41K) (update link).

ML reporting on Alps.
CK asks how to do benchmarking.
Nobody really knows. (ML should write something here)

### Guillaume Bertolli
Last 3 years build ML implementation for ecrad.
Next: instead of only predicting contrib of radiation on temp, the sum of all (ask JJ for more details). Still havent constructed dataset.
### Emmanuele Russo
icon-clm: finally found optimal calibration for euro-cordex domain. model perf pretty good, particulary compared to cosmo-clm.
applied several model developments, including routine for transient aerosol. 
AL asks if it will be on CPU
ER: will be on CPU, the Germans are not interested in GPUs.

### Brigitta Goger
uses icon below 1km. limited area setup in Austria
has accepted paper about it.
hecometric range: perhaps there is issue with smagorinsky model (clearly bias at least)
side project with NA: explored representation of clouds at 1km and 65m (1-moment and 2-moment): rather represent on resolution(?) than on microphysics scheme


### Clarissa Kroll
getting icon xtp setup, merge it on icon-exlcaim. 
working on radi dumping option

### Doris Folini
just here to inform herself on icon

### Fulden Batibeniz
goal to use icon-clm configuration (hopefully on gpu)
needs to do benchmarking (not possible yet)
project about seasonal predictions.
### Nander Wever
works at slf. main task snow pack development. financed by mch. want to make it opr for next winter season.

### Sylvaine Ferrachat
icon-ham: no new development since last meeting
going to do soon: set up icon-ham as global simulation. Climatology r2b8
### Jacopo Canton
mostly working with icon4py. using icon mostly as validation. just here to be kept up to date
### Sven Kotlarski
climate department of mch. trys o link icon-clm develpment to climate scenarios. heard that it will take some more time but luckily the scenarios does not have real dependency but it would be nice to have somehing available. does not do any coding of icon (doesnt know about details)
### David Leutwyler
supports team X campaig in austria, writing proposal for cscs
### Christian Steger
numerical weather forecasting team. looking  topographic setting for surface radiation. which parametrisations make sense to port
if you run on complex terrain on high resolution please let me know
### Mikael Stellio
works on icon-ham on gpu side. now working on tracer advection and trys to optimize it
### Alina Yapparova
part of glory project. data simulation of 3d radar simulations. running icon with icon and emvorado (fixed bug in emvorado).
### Lukas Jansing
started working in send last september. was getting model ready for simulations. still need to finish product imigration. trying to find better configuration for production. still bias of temp in valleys. sarted working in glory-A. first set of 500m simulations. no significatn results so far.
### Fabiag Gessler
most of time getting icon operational on gpus. next thing is to get further perfomance improvement. using more nodes than they would like. will probably also contribute to glory project in future
### Arash Hamzehloo
porting components of ART to GPUs. testing new code based on co2 over zurich.
project was originally financed (?) by PASC

### Dominik Brunner
do a lot of greenhouase gas modeling. GPU ports have been very essential. they are moving over now to GPU version
also do air pollution modelling. icon-art also does chemistry. couldnt do all the processes needed yet. has postdoc to do that. look at impact of net-zero scenarios: how would that ipact air polluution. had 2 day training course for icon-art: set up exercise to do air pollution setup on levante.
