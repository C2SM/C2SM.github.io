## Reports

### C2SM (Michael Jähn, Annika Lauber, Matthieu Leclair)

MJ welcomes all the participants to the meeting and presents the [news from C2SM about ICON](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/8yXCB1ZKlhly3DN).

ER asks if they are aware of the tests for the aerosol dataset.
MJ replies that he is not sure where that is.
ER asks how many nestings they you have in their domain and what the setup is and if it is definite.
MJ replies that it's the EURO-CORDEX setup. The resolution is 12km for now but they want to go higher later.
ER says that they are still struggling to find an appropriate setup.
MJ says that they are using SPACE, so the default configuration.
ER warns that the default configuration has problems with radiation and 2m temperature and there is still work going on. Despite a higher radiation, the 2m temperature is too low. They are still working on it in the CLM community and should have something next month.
MJ says that they are a bit under time pressure and wants to discuss offline.

AL presents the latest progress with the two-moment microphysics scheme on GPU.
BG asks since when the explicit scheme is on the master.
AL answers that it was merged a few weeks ago (information on that can be found on the GitHub issue [Speed up two-moment microphysics scheme on GPU](https://github.com/C2SM/Tasks-Support/issues/3)).
WS asks why the implicit scheme is not running on Daint.
AL replies that this is due to a compiler bug, which will not be fixed before Daint's decommissioning.

AL presents the latest progress in the probtest (tolerance tests) development.
JZ asks if the GPU run is wrong, it means that it is physically wrong.
AL answers that if there is a bug in the GPU port it can be physically wrong but small bugs may not be obviously physically wrong.


### Andrea Stenke
icon-art to simulate atm. cycles of trace elements. model devlopments. seting up global amip type simulation. running on euler. 
Do you have more input files on CSCS?
MJ: depends what you want
AS will ask for specific resolution to have available on euler
WS we have data for test cases for alsmot everything you can think of. We can port it over from levante.

### Brigitta Goger
icon on daint. Limited area set up with high resolution, down to 100m?. Newest version of ICON model is stable also belwow 100m, works down to 65m. 

### Guillaume Bertolli
icon on rad. part of model. Try to emulate radiation on ML. Issue with toper atmo. is solved by using super simple model. Can speed up by a factor of 3 (overall).
TS: how often do you call radiation
GB: every 3 minutes
WS: what do you cmpare with
GB: compare GPU version with ecrad compared to ML version

### Stefan Rüdisühli
setting up hgi resolution setup over atlantic. 
News from SEbastian: aquaplanet simulation paper accepted

### Jan Zibell
analysis ICON simulations. Will start with aquaplanet ensemble. Storm tracks. with 1 degree simulation.
ML: how long is period, how many ensembles. Global at 1 degree
JZ: five times 10 years. For high resolved you have to ask SS or AD

### Mikael Stellio
icon-ham works with Sylvaine. GPU ports. Run with a resolution 160km. past months managed to run with 40km, plan to go to less but have problems with input data. Did scaling analysis. Doesnt scale that well more tracesrs than icon-nwp. 
problem with pollen simulation, helped there. Played with new version of probtest, could reduce to 5 members. It's stable for now.

### Will Sawyer
number of delays, alps will take longer than hoped. Daint will be decomissiond some time in summer next year. January: virtual cluster system will look like several machines, so pre-alp system will devoted specifically to exclaim. Will start compiling dsl branch in January and try to get first benchmarks. New system should be up in April/may then daint will be gone quickly.

### Doris Folini
didnt work with icon recently. on behalf of Borian who uses ancient version of icon, hopefully revision come back as long as daint is still there.

### Emmanuelle Russo
same version with echam-physics. quite some developments. version of icon called icon-dry runs with convection and cloud mcrph. Oppurtunity to add weight in model to change value of ssts.

### Fulden Batibeniz

run icon with seasonal precition investingint draught but no moisture availble on layers. If you have something available, let her know
WS: we might have that type of data. Not aware of layer moisture or what it will be named. presumably it is on levante.

### Clarissa Kroll
works with icon-dsl. km simulation hopefully on alps. atm. response to different sst patches on the pacific. Doeing sensitivy tests with icon. Soil moisture data should be available but it is super difficult to get access, via MCH and it takes months. Would be much easier if it is available on levante
WS: have there been no more technical issues?
CK: model is running
WS working on pre-alps system also
CK supposed to do tests in April
