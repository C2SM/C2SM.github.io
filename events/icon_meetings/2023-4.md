### C2SM (Michael J채hn, Annika Lauber, Matthieu Leclair)

MJ welcomes all the participants to the meeting and presents the [news from C2SM about ICON](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/8yXCB1ZKlhly3DN).

ER: Are you aware of tests for aerosol dataset.
MJ: Not sure where that is
ER can give more hints. Something was already done. How many nestings do you have in domain. What is setup? Is it definite
MJ: it`s the euro cordex set up. 12km for now. Want to go higher later
ER: still struggling to find appropriate set up.
MJ using SPACE
ER: default config: be careful becaseu there are problems with radiation and 2m temperature. Still working going on. Despite higher radiation, too low 2m temp. What is plan? In the CLM community we are still working and will have something next month.
MJ: bit under time pressure. The sooner the better. Let's discuss offline.

BG: since when is explicit in master
WS: why doesn't implicit run on Daint

JZ: if the GPU run is wrong, is it physically wrong?


### AS
icon-art to simulate atm. cycles of trace elements. model devlopments. seting up global amip type simulation. running on euler. 
Do you have more input files on CSCS?
MJ: depends what you want
AS will ask for specific resolution to have available on euler
WS we have data for test cases for alsmot everything you can think of. We can port it over from levante.

### BG
icon on daint. Limited area set up with high resolution, down to 100m?. Newest version of ICON model is stable also belwow 100m, works down to 65m. 

### GB
icon on rad. part of model. Try to emulate radiation on ML. Issue with toper atmo. is solved by using super simple model. Can speed up by a factor of 3 (overall).
TS: how often do you call radiation
GB: every 3 minutes
WS: what do you cmpare with
GB: compare GPU version with ecrad compared to ML version

### SR
setting up hgi resolution setup over atlantic. 
News from SEbastian: aquaplanet simulation paper accepted

### JZ
analysis ICON simulations. Will start with aquaplanet ensemble. Storm tracks. with 1 degree simulation.
ML: how long is period, how many ensembles. Global at 1 degree
JZ: five times 10 years. For high resolved you have to ask SS or AD

### Mikael Stellio
icon-ham works with Sylvaine. GPU ports. Run with a resolution 160km. past months managed to run with 40km, plan to go to less but have problems with input data. Did scaling analysis. Doesnt scale that well more tracesrs than icon-nwp. 
problem with pollen simulation, helped there. Played with new version of probtest, could reduce to 5 members. It's stable for now.

### WS
number of delays, alps will take longer than hoped. Daint will be decomissiond some time in summer next year. January: virtual cluster system will look like several machines, so pre-alp system will devoted specifically to exclaim. Will start compiling dsl branch in January and try to get first benchmarks. New system should be up in April/may then daint will be gone quickly.

### DF
didnt work with icon recently. on behalf of Borian who uses ancient version of icon, hopefully revision come back as long as daint is still there.

### ER
same version with echam-physics. quite some developments. version of icon called icon-dry runs with convection and cloud mcrph. Oppurtunity to add weight in model to change value of ssts.

### FB
run icon with seasonal precition investingint draught but no moisture availble on layers. If you have something available, let her know
WS: we might have that type of data. Not aware of layer moisture or what it will be named. presumably it is on levante.

### CK
works with icon-dsl. km simulation hopefully on alps. atm. response to different sst patches on the pacific. Doeing sensitivy tests with icon. Soil moisture data should be available but it is super difficult to get access, via MCH and it takes months. Would be much easier if it is available on levante
WS: have there been no more technical issues?
CK: model is running
WS working on pre-alps system also
CK supposed to do tests in April
