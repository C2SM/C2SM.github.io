# Climate Model and Climate Data Workshop

C2SM offers a **Climate Model and Climate Data Workshop**, open to the entire C2SM community, with a particular focus on researchers working on climate impacts. This workshop is part of our [technical training :material-open-in-new:](https://c2sm.ethz.ch/education/technical-training.html){:target="_blank"}.

In this workshop, we address key questions such as "How do climate models work?" and discuss important considerations when using climate model data. We also provide a brief introduction to reanalysis and observational data.

The workshop features a hands-on session where participants learn how to work with climate data. Topics include:

- Understanding the widely used **NetCDF** data format
- Reading NetCDF data into **Python** and **R**
- Performing simple calculations using **Climate Data Operators (CDO)**

First held in December 2023, this workshop is now offered annually.
