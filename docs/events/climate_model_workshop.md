# Climate Model and Climate Data Workshop
C2SM is offering a climate model and climate data workshop for the C2SM Impacts community.
This workshop is part of our [technical training :material-open-in-new:](https://c2sm.ethz.ch/education/technical-training.html){:target="_blank"}.
The workshop provides an introduction to the concept and functionality of climate models and includes a short hands-on session.
We answer questions like "How do climate models work?", talk about considerations when using climate model data and give a short introduction to 
re-â€‹analysis and observational data.

The course took place for the first time December 6th 2023 and we are planning to repeat it annually.
