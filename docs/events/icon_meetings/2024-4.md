## Reports

### C2SM (Michael Jähn, Annika Lauber, Matthieu Leclair, Jonas Jucker)
MJ welcomes everyone and shares the [latest news about ICON from C2SM :material-download:](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/VxGeKGz6WepXDIE){:target="_blank"}.

The C2SM Core Team would be happy to get feedback about their services and asks everybody to fill out their survey: [C2SM Core Team Survey :material-open-in-new:](https://forms.gle/UR3NqbfZM4vKVFr58){:target="_blank"}.


**Discussion about ALPS**

MK reports that they hope Säntis will be up and running tomorrow. If users previously had access to Säntis on Pre-Alps, it should work the same way again.

JJ asks whether Säntis will remain available and if it is possible to build on top of it. MK confirms, explaining that Säntis will be the final vcluster. Initially, it will consist of 500 GH nodes, but this setup might change over time and could become a hybrid system.

AH notes that they did not have access to Säntis and asks if they will gain access. MK inquires if AH is running ICON and states that they will need to check. MK also mentions that Daint should be set up this week and that images may need to be adapted, as they are currently configured for Todi but not for Daint. AH reiterates their question about gaining access to Säntis, and MK commits to clarifying this.

DF adds that it would be beneficial for everyone to gain access to Säntis and asks MK to check this for all users.

TS suggests verifying if additional projects are running on Säntis and advises getting in touch with Anurag for further coordination

**Discussion about Setup CSCS-CI for Alps**

WS asks what needs to happen to get the trigger mechanism working. JJ explains that they received feedback from Ralf and Sergey but still need to figure out how to trigger a manually launched pipeline. WS inquires who JJ needs to speak to for clarification. JJ responds that it will likely be Ralf. WS concludes that it is just a matter of time before the issue is resolved, and JJ agrees.


## Will Sawyer
a lot going on at CSCS. Where do put test and run data. It's a bit of a mess right now. 

MK probably add mount point to Säntis and Balfrin on store or scratch
SK: would need to access tödi/säntis store from Balfrin.

MK discussion with André and Xavier.

MK probably makes sense to have data on säntis

WS do you need to write?
SK probably not. read access probably not

MK if write access required, there would maybe be a solution

DL same issue is also read-only access on CPU cluster on clariden

MK clariden and säntis access same store

DL: if you solve it for one, do you solve it for both?

MK: users on clariden and säntis will access same store


## Sven Kotlarski
Open question who will become EXCLAIM PI? Will Christoph continue or Andreas takes over

## Alina
Still working on data assimilation. Using EMVORADO

## CS
two topics: looked into new topography dataset for extpar. if you want to run hight resolution, rasta has serious ... effects
other dataset looks quite promosing for running high resolution

lradtopo stuff. unified ICON code from cosmo. should be finished soon

## MikS
finished transition to alps for icon.ham. everything is running. did benchmarks for produciton proposal, looks quite nice, tested 90 levels, required 1000 gpus.

Moved back to old daint, to finish something with lohmann. 16% speedup on ham.
will finish a couple of cleanups

solve problems in the radiation inerface. 5 four-d fields whicht take up 30% of the memory. Have to use much less nproma, which is not great for performance 

MJ. on how many nodes do you run, what are results
MikS run on 44 nodes

## DL
worked with Lukas on precipitation, two much spread on long lead-times. also see too intense precipitation on intentse events. very slow progress. CSCS proposal for TeamX, got declined, even though it had two excellent reviews. No contribution from Switzerland for winter. So not good news on this.

TS: were discussing this with exclaim, question if we could take over the simulation but not sure if for winter

DL time window is closing, because the campaign is in February 

TS will check with Oli and Anurag

## NW

still working on gettting mixed snow model into main branch from icon. 

## DF
not much to share, did becnhermarking for cscs-proposal with icon-exclaim code. r2b7. wnated to go higher but Tödi to unstable. Ported all icon code to new daint as they want to be ready, in case it's needed.

## YY
wanted to do benchmark on tödi wih coarse resolution but tödi not very stable. will start euro-44 again next year.

## AH
managed to compile and run icon-art on Tödi. Managed to merge nwp matser branch. Hopefully next few days will open mr. will contact gatekeeper at KIT. Hopefully in the next OS release 

next year trying to extent. chemistry part of ART

## EK
EK: not working on icon but with ICON. We can run atmospheric inversions for productin using processing chain.


## TS
will be official icon partners. Contract should be signed in February.


## MK
Got news now.
MK cluster will have 500 nodes. projects which use icon will end up on Säntis
