## Reports

### C2SM (Michael Jähn, Annika Lauber, Matthieu Leclair)
MJ welcomes everyone and shares the [latest news about ICON from C2SM :material-open-in-new:](){:target="_blank"}.

AD asks about transient aerosol port and who helped to fix the bug.
AL answers that many people were involved and that it were actually 3 bugs, which made it really hard to find.
MJ: The port also takes so long because many people are involved and communication can take a while.

WS asks if prepartory projects can really be submitted at any time
MK project proposals will be gathered for the deadlines but any time for preparatory projects.

CS isolrad: what is that doing?
MJ cannot say much

AH Alps: were giving access to Daint but don't have user env on Daint. Struggle with ICON on new system. Erik was trying to compile ICON with MJ helps, he managed to. Asks if they should ahve access to Säntis rather than Daint?
ML: question that goes back to CSCS. Whatever CSCS decides, WEatehr on climate only on Säntis or shared between Säntis and Tödi. Ben Cumming thought everything should run on Säntis. As soon as we have information from CSCS how it's gonna be, we will support it. Is your access in form of a prepraroty project?
AH it's a bigger project. Thought they have admin right to create user env. 
ML says that they can. At the beginning we should rely on what is available
MK difference betwen tödi säntis and alps will be very minimal. It should work the same way on all systems. You don't need admin roight to create user env. But it will take some time to get used to the new system. He can imagine o start tagging user env made for a certain system. But most of them should be visible. Posts two links:
- General information: https://github.com/eth-cscs/UserLabDay/blob/master/2024/general_information_alps.pdf
- GitHub repo: https://github.com/eth-cscs/UserLabDay/tree/master/2024
AH asks if it will be Daint or Säntis on the long run
MK says that säntis is exclusively to climate and weather but mainly to ICON (EXCLAIM). There will be a few things going to Daint.
DF my collegeues are also doing benchmarking on Tödi, now on Daint.Alps. The images were not availble on Tödi were missing on Daint.Alps. Will they come?
ML says that you should not rely on his images anymore. There is a workaround with the user env. You can make querys to the data base to see what is installed on the system.
DF is that true also if you don't have access to Tödi?
ML thinks yes
DF can we hope that the images on Tödi will be on Daint?
ML even if it's not the long term solution, it should be deployed on Daint. It's not straightforward like it is right now.
DF many people have to do the benchmarking till October
AH we should be able to compile ICON by loading the user env without those images?
ML software slack image is the same as the user env. On each cluster of have access to the uenvs. It's not always straightforward to use it. At the moment the images are interchangable but they still depend on the OS? It could be the future that a uenv on one cluster doesnt work on the other
MK yes the risk is there. They have seen compatability for MCH. Regarding images on DAint: the nvidia part is not there. It was not provided completely, which is why he created another env. Not preloaded on the system, so you have to look for them using the uenv tool.
uenv image find -s todi (not checking if you have access to todi). You can give this a try.

BG uses tödi. Instructions on C2SM worked but 2 weeks later executables did not work anymore and instructions were gone.
ML there is now the Alps section on landing page. should be possbile to do the same as before but dont use absolute path to my env. You can now do it with tags. Instructions are on workshop material page but also on user landing page. dont hesitate to annoy ML on Slack

AD empa uses icon-art. did you manage to run this also?
ML no, only been testing regular icon. Erik was successful in compiling
AH yes he was but he followed the workaround.
AD there is a plan for C2SM to compile ICON-ART?
ML not in the C2SM pipeline. We suggest that users come up with a test case and we help setting up the ci infrasctructure.
AH says that they have test case (icon-kit) but very old and needs to be updated.
MJ icon-art is now part of icon-nwp. You could set up test case , which we could add
DF default version of ICON. Had to work on runscripts, are they planned to be used on Alps like this.
ML not yet on the final ICON
DF do you have a timeline
ML will still take a bit of time
MJ we provide latest os release and our testing
WS: Jonas corporated CSCS-CI into normal BB workflow. Software largly available. Sets up service user. Have project for that. A few things to do before Jonas gets back. Discussion about mechansim for triggering the runners, so we have to talk to Ralf and Sergey. 3 or 4 works till CI system is running (cant be much longer as they want to have overlap with Piz Daint, so end of October).
ML: whole CI infrascture but the runscripts are available.
DF experience last week: if doing simple test case (helsuare) has to furnish runscript herself. If using job reporting tool suggested by CSCS
WS: we will have to talk about as he is not immediately involved in. Wants to talk about it offline with Matthias 
DF: there are several people relying on that.
