# Quarterly ICON Meeting

We invite C2SM community members to participate in our quarterly C2SM ICON Meeting, which is designed to facilitate knowledge exchange among researchers and users.
This regular meeting serves as a forum for the C2SM community to discuss their ongoing projects, share research findings, and collaborate effectively.
The meeting also offers an avenue to receive updates on the latest developments in the ICON model from the C2SM Core Team.
Moreover, it encourages interactions and collaboration with research groups from ETH Zurich, MeteoSwiss, Empa, and CSCS. 

In case you have any questions or suggestions, contact the meeting organiser,
[Michael JÃ¤hn :material-open-in-new:](https://c2sm.ethz.ch/the-center/people/person-detail.html?persid=286091){:target="_blank"}.
