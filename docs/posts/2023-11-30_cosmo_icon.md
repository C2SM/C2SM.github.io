It will take place at the **Radisson Blu Hotel**, next to MeteoSwiss.

The COSMO/ICON User Workshop is a rather informal one-day event, whose goal is to bring together users and developers of these two models, 
to share experience and knowledge, and to get insights into some projects involving these models. 
 
Please register for the workshop by email to _andreas.pauling@meteoswiss.ch_ by **December 18th, 2023**.
You are strongly encouraged to present a poster or to give a talk at this informal event!  Please include a preliminary title in your email if you plan to do so.
