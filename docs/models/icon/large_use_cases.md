# Large Use Cases

[ICON :material-open-in-new:](https://www.icon-model.org/icon_model){:target="_blank"} is a complex piece of software and even more so is [ICON-EXCLAIM :material-open-in-new:](https://github.com/C2SM/icon-exclaim){:target="_blank"} that builds on top of it. Troubleshooting large scale configurations can therefore be tedious, which is why we developed a procedure to build large production ICON configurations in the most robust way possible.

The overall philosophy is to build a series of gradually increasing complexity setups from a small scale ICON test case to the full production configuration. Even if it could feel like an overhead when starting the whole process, C2SM's core team is there to assist you in this journey and it will pay off in the end!

## 1. Small Scale Test Case

The idea here is to test the code path of the final setup and identify potential issues coming from upstream source code.

### 1.1 Set up

**Clone**

First, clone [`icon-nwp` :material-open-in-new:](https://gitlab.dkrz.de/icon/icon-nwp){:target="_blank"} (if you don't have access, you need to request it by DKRZ):

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@gitlab.dkrz.de:icon/icon-nwp.git
```

**Create test case**

Then set up an ICON test case with a low number of grid points and a few time steps (about 6) and save it under `run/exp.<my_exp>`. Existing use cases like the [Aquaplanet :material-open-in-new:](https://gitlab.dkrz.de/icon/icon-nwp/-/blob/master/run/exp.exclaim_ape_R02B04){:target="_blank"} one can serve as a template.

**Add test case to checksuite**

Follow the step-by-step guide in [How to add experiments to a buildbot list :material-open-in-new:](https://gitlab.dkrz.de/icon/wiki/-/wikis/How-to-setup-new-test-experiments-for-buildbot#how-to-add-experiments-to-a-buildbot-list){:target="_blank"} to add your test case to the checksuite. Start with the `checksuite_modes` for the mpi and nproma tests (`'nm'`) for the machine you are testing on.

**Compile out-of-source**

We recommend you to do out-of-source builds for CPU and GPU so that you can have two compiled versions of ICON in the same repository. Therefore, you simply need to create two folders in the the ICON root folder (e.g. `nvhpc_cpu` and `nvhpc_cpu`) and copy the folders `config` and `scripts` from the root folder into it:

```bash
mkdir nvhpc_cpu
cd nvhpc_cpu
cp -r ../config ../scripts .
mkdir nvhpc_gpu
cd nvhpc_gpu
cp -r ../config ../scripts .
```

Then follow the instructions in [Configure and compile :material-open-in-new:](usage.md/#configure-and-compile){:target="_blank"} to compile ICON on CPU and on GPU from within those folders.

### 1.2 Local testing

Before adding anything to the official ICON, we recommend you to run all tests locally first starting with CPU.

#### Test on CPU
To ensure that there are no basic issues with the namelist, we recommend to start testing on CPU before going over to GPU testing. Create the check file and run the test locally in the folder you built CPU in (set `EXP=<exp_name>`):

```bash
./make_runscripts ${EXP}
./run/make_target_runscript in_script=checksuite.icon-dev/check.${EXP} in_script=exec.iconrun out_script=check.${EXP}.run EXPNAME=${EXP}
cd run
sbatch --partition debug --time 00:30:00 check.${EXP}.run
```

Check in the LOG file if all tests passed.

#### Test on GPU
If all tests are validating on CPU, the next step is to test on GPU. Follow the same steps as for CPU and run nproma and mpi test. Again, check in the LOG file if all tests passed before going over to the next step.

To ensure that running on GPU gives basically the same results as running on CPU. Therefore, please follow the instructions in [Validating with probtest without buildbot references (Generating tolerances for non standard tests) :material-open-in-new:](https://gitlab.dkrz.de/icon/wiki/-/wikis/GPU-development/Validating-with-probtest-without-buildbot-references-(Generating-tolerances-for-non-standard-tests)){:target="_blank"}). If probtest validates, you can change the `checksuite_modes` to `'t'` and everything is set for activating the test in a CI pipeline.

### 1.3 Activate Test in a CI Pipeline
If you followed the steps above in [1.2 Local testing](large_use_cases.md#12-local-testing), everything is set to activate the test in a CI pipeline. Therefore, push your changes to a branch on icon-nwp and open a merge request. Then follow the instructions in [Member selection for generating probtest tolerances :material-open-in-new:](https://gitlab.dkrz.de/icon/wiki/-/wikis/GPU-development/Member-selection-for-generating-probtest-tolerances){:target="_blank"} for adding tolerances and references as well as best members for generating them to the CI pipeline.


## 2. Intermediate Scale Tests

To test the scalability of ICON simulations under demanding conditions while minimizing queue wait times, we can design tests to stretch computational limits in memory and time. Here are some steps to extend your setup to meet these goals.

### 2.1 Increase Horizontal Resolution with Fixed Node Count

*Goal:* Test memory scaling behavior by increasing resolution without increasing node count.

*Method:* 
Increase the model's horizontal grid resolution (i.e., decrease grid spacing) to improve spatial accuracy. 
        This will require more memory per node due to higher data density but will not increase the node count.
        Monitor the memory usage closely on each node, and consider using profiling tools to track memory allocation patterns and potential memory overflow risks.


*Expected Outcome:* This test will reveal the memory thresholds on individual nodes for your current setup and may highlight areas where memory optimization or node allocation adjustments are necessary.


*Notes:* Approaching the memory limits without exceeding them can help identify how close the current node allocation is to becoming unsustainable at higher resolutions. If necessary, consider using memory-aware scheduling tools to balance memory loads across nodes if available.

### 2.2 Run Longer Simulations (e.g., 1 Year vs. 1 Month)

*Goal:* Assess the model's stability and resource consumption over prolonged simulation periods, revealing any potential issues with computational drift or resource leaks.

*Method:* Run the simulation for an extended period, like one year instead of one month, to test how well the model holds up over time.
This will allow for testing both numerical stability (are there signs of drift?) and resource persistence (are there memory leaks or increasing CPU demands?).

*Expected Outcome:* Running for a longer period may expose issues like numerical drift, stability loss, or escalating memory/CPU demands that arenâ€™t noticeable in shorter simulations.
