# Alps

[Hardware description :material-open-in-new:](https://www.cscs.ch/computers/alps){:target="_blank"}

Alps can be considered as a *meta-machine* composed of several so-called [*vclusters*](vclusters.md) (virtual clusters).
From the user's perspective, these are the equivalent of our previous machines (e.g., Piz Daint).

The recording of the [C2SM workshop "Switching to Alps"](../blog/posts/2024-07-02_switching_to_Alps.md) from August 12, 2024 will be uploaded here as soon as it is available.
