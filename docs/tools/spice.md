# SPICE

SPICE stands for **S**tarter **P**ackage for **I**CON-**C**LM **E**xperiments. It is a processing chain that handles pre-processing of the input,
setting up namelists, running the simulation and archiving/post-processing. It contains the latest setup for ICON-CLM
runs by the CLM community.

The code has been adapted for running on Piz Daint and is distributed to users via the C2SM GitHub organisation. Regular testing is done via [Jenkins :material-open-in-new:](https://jenkins-mch.cscs.ch/job/Spice/job/spice-weekly/){:target="_blank"} (requires access) to ensure that the code runs stably on the system.

If there are any questions or you want to provide your ICON-CLM setup, please contact [Michael JÃ¤hn :material-open-in-new:](https://c2sm.ethz.ch/the-center/people/person-detail.html?persid=286091){:target="_blank"}.
