# Icon USER Workshop (formerly Cosmo ICON User Workshop)

Since the transition from Piz Daint to the new Alps infrastructure is already taking place, 
we have added a new navigation section [Alps](../../alps/index.md) to collect all necessary information there.

Most importantly, C2SM users will find details about the new vClusters as well as how to
use User Environments (uenvs) in order to access the software stacks.
