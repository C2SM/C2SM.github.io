# Icon USER Workshop (formerly COSMO ICON User Workshop)


ICON User Workshop on **4 February 2025** as a physical meeting. It will take place at the ETH Zentrum Campus in the heart of Zurich.
 
The ICON User Workshop is a rather informal one-day event, whose goal is to bring together users and developers of the model, to share experience and knowledge, and to get insights into some projects involving ICON. The program will include both talks and extended poster sessions. Talks will be limited to few keynote presentations.
The length of the talks is flexible, around 10 to 30 Minutes. The authors of the posters will have the opportunity to present their work during the poster session.

Review last year's [contributions](https://c2sm.github.io/events/CIUW/2024/) for inspiration.
 
Please register for the workshop by sending an email to jonas.jucker(at)c2sm.ethz.ch by December 18th, 2024.
