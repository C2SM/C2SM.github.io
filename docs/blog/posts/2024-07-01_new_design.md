# Welcome to Our Website's New Look!

We are pleased to announce that our website has a new design as of today! This change is more than just a visual refresh; it's about improving the way we share our projects and related documentation. Our goal has always been to provide you with a smooth and engaging experience on our website, and this redesign brings us closer to that goal.

## Why We Chose Material for MkDocs

For this redesign, we chose [Material for MkDocs :material-open-in-new:](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/){:target="_blank"}, a tool that helps us create a modern and responsive site. Material for MkDocs is also the tool of choice for CSCS and their documentation pages.

A big advantage of Material for MkDocs is how it helps us keep a consistent style across all our documentation. It is important to us that whether we are working on current projects or starting new ones, you always get clear and accessible information. This tool is a big help in achieving that.

## New Features

- Switch between dark and light mode
- News are managed with the `blog` feature and appear more prominently in the navigation bar
- Table of Content now visible for each site on the right side bar
- Clear distinction between internal and external hyperlinks
- Replaced [Datasets](../../datasets/climate_model_data.md) tables with sections and listings
- The [source code :material-open-in-new:](https://github.com/C2SM/c2sm.github.io){:target="_blank"} is now public (so you can try it out by yourself)

## Your Thoughts Matter

Your feedback is crucial for us as we continue to improve. If you have any suggestions or thoughts on the new design, we would love to hear from you.
