# COSMO/ICON User Workshop

published 30/11/2023
{: .label .label-grey}

We announce the COSMO/ICON User Workshop on **12 February 2024** as a physical meeting. Due to space constraints at MeteoSwiss, it will take place at the airport Radisson Hotel next to MeteoSwiss.
 
The COSMO/ICON User Workshop is a rather informal one-day event, whose goal is to bring together users and developers of these two models, 
to share experience and knowledge, and to get insights into some projects involving these models. 
 
Please register for the workshop by email to _andreas.pauling@meteoswiss.ch_ by **December 18th, 2023**.
You are strongly encouraged to present a poster or to give a talk at this informal event!  Please include a preliminary title in your email if you plan to do so.

Your contribution could be an overview of activities revolving around these models, 
a description of a technical problem that you are dealing with at the moment, 
results from a specific project, or a demonstration of a tool that can be useful for other COSMO/ICON users.
