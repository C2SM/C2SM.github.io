# Tasks from Third-Party Projects
As outlined in [C2SM's business plan for 2021-25](https://ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/usys/c2sm-dam/center/documents/c2sm_business_plan_final_18nov19.pdf), the Executive Office also relies heavily on funding from third-party projects. We are therefore happy to contribute to the research projects of our members (e.g. SNF, EU, ETH) in our fields of expertise.

## Third-Party Projects that Benefit Multiple C2SM Groups
These can be projects of individual C2SM members as PI, possibly together with other co-PIs from the community, funding individual tasks of core team programmers. These projects will be supported in particular if the results will benefit several C2SM groups.

## Third-Party Projects with Benefits to the PI Only
A member may also propose a task/tasks to be funded from their project, but where the benefit is limited to their group. These proposals will be realized if C2SM capacity is available. However, they will have a lower priority than projects with a greater benefit to the community.

## Task Portfolio
The core team's contributions consist largely of technical model development and support tasks. Individual tasks may also include setting up and maintaining a project website, or organizing individual workshops or seminar series.

## Procedure for Proposing Participation in a Third-Party Project
- The project PI contacts the C2SM Executive Director (ED) at the proposal stage by submitting a written proposal similar to the task proposals for group tasks;
- The ED, along with an assigned core team member, will provide feedback to the PI and may review the proposal again;
- If the proposal meets the above conditions, C2SM will consider it accepted and reserve time for its execution in the following year;
- C2SM will reserve approximately 3-7 person months (0.3-0.6 FTE) per year for tasks from external projects.
