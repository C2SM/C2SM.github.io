# Task Assignment

The C2SM Executive Office accepts tasks from C2SM member groups, third-party projects, and C2SM Community projects.

The terms, conditions and procedures for receiving our support are described below.
Please submit a task by following the instructions on our GitHub repository [Tasks-Support](https://github.com/C2SM/Tasks-Support).

## Requirements for Tasks
Tasks are one-â€‹time assignments that typically involve the development of a new model feature, acceleration/optimization of a model feature, or other technical improvements to a model. Tasks are proposed by one or more C2SM members and approved by the C2SM [Working Groups](https://c2sm.github.io/tasks/working_groups.html) (WGs). They must be related to our supported [tools](https://c2sm.github.io/tools/) and [models](https://c2sm.github.io/models/).

## Procedure
1. **Submission:**
Tasks can be submitted as issues through our GitHub repository [Tasks-Support](https://github.com/C2SM/Tasks-Support) at any time. The task proposal must include a description and goals of the task, a time estimate, a statement of urgency, the groups involved, and at least one contact person. It should also describe the benefit to C2SM. Please follow the instructions for [Submit a Task](https://github.com/C2SM/Tasks-Support#submit-a-task).

2. **Evaluation:**
The Core Team will evaluate the proposals and may provide feedback/ask questions/reiterate the proposals to the groups. Priority will be given to tasks with greater benefit to multiple C2SM groups. Updates on the tasks will be given directly on the submitted task in the GitHub repository.

3. **Core Team starts working on task:**
Depending on the urgency or current workload of the Core Team, C2SM may begin work on the task immediately or at a later date

4. **Feedback and Discussion of Tasks:**
During the semi-annual WG Day, to which representatives of each C2SM group member are invited, the status and future of submitted tasks are discussed. Members can provide critical feedback on the process.

## Overview of current tasks

An overview of all submitted tasks can be found as the [issues](https://github.com/C2SM/Tasks-Support/issues) in our [Tasks-Support](https://github.com/C2SM/Tasks-Support) repository.

The current status of all tasks for each WG is displayed within the [C2SM projects](https://github.com/C2SM/Tasks-Support/projects?query=is%3Aopen).
