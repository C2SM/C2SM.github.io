# Task Assignment

The C2SM Executive Office accepts tasks from C2SM member groups, third-party projects, and C2SM community projects.

The terms, conditions and procedures for receiving our support are described below.
Please submit a task by following the instructions on our GitHub repository [Tasks-Support](https://github.com/C2SM/Tasks-Support).

## Requirements for Tasks
Tasks are one-â€‹time assignments that typically involve the development of a new model feature, acceleration/optimization of a model feature, or other technical improvements to a model. Tasks are proposed by one or more C2SM members and approved by the C2SM Working Groups (WGs). They must be related to our supported [tools](https://c2sm.github.io/tools/) and [models](https://c2sm.github.io/models/).

## Overview of current tasks

An overview of all submitted tasks can be found as the [issues](https://github.com/C2SM/Tasks-Support/issues) of our [Tasks-Support](https://github.com/C2SM/Tasks-Support) repository.

The current status of all tasks for each WG is displayed within the [C2SM projects](https://github.com/C2SM/Tasks-Support/projects?query=is%3Aopen).
