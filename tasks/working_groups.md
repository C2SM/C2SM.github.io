# Working Groups

## WG 1 - High Performance Computing for Weather and Climate Modeling : activities which primarily focus on modern technologies
This group aims at further developing and using weather and climate models like ICON or COSMO using new technologies (e.g. beyond CPU architectures).

## WG 2 - Weather and Climate models development, usage, maintenance and support (excluding WG1 activities)
This group focuses on any modelling related activities (weather and climate models and their potential extensions, e.g. aerosols, chemistry, and ESMs), not primarily focusing on new technologies (WG1). The tasks can be, for instance, coupling of model components, general tools around pre- and postprocessing, automated testing, etc.

## WG 3 - Next Generation Swiss Climate Scenarios
This group focuses on Next Generation Swiss Climate Scenarios.

## WG 4 - Impact Research
This group focuses on providing climate data for impacts research. Tasks can be, for example, standardizing and documenting climate model output or climate observations for easier use. We also provide support in how to use this kind of data as a regular support.
