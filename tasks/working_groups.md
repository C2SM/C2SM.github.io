# Working Groups

## WG 1 - High Performance Computing for Weather and Climate Modeling: activities which primarily focus on modern technologies
The goal of this group is to further develop and use weather and climate models such as ICON or COSMO using new technologies (e.g. beyond CPU architectures).

## WG 2 - Weather and Climate models development, usage, maintenance and support (excluding WG1 activities)
This group focuses on all modeling related activities (weather and climate models and their potential extensions, e.g. aerosols, chemistry, and ESMs), not primarily on new technologies (WG1). Tasks may include coupling of model components, general tools around pre- and post-processing, automated testing, etc.

## WG 3 - Next Generation Swiss Climate Scenarios
This group focuses on the Next Generation Swiss Climate Scenarios.

## WG 4 - Impact Research
This group focuses on providing climate data for impact research. Tasks may include standardizing and documenting climate model outputs or climate observations for easier use. We also provide regular support on how to use this type of data.
