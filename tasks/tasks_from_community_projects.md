# Tasks from Community Projects
Tasks are also taken from C2SM Community Projects. These are large, perennial, and joint research and/or development projects involving at least three C2SM groups and two different partner institutions, with a substantial financial volume. Their overall objective supports the implementation of one or more of the four pillars of C2SM. The project produces results that no single group could have produced on its own. Their results benefit a large majority of C2SM members. These projects receive significant support from C2SM core funding in the form of in-kind contributions from core staff.

## Community Project Task Assignment Process
- The C2SM Steering Committee (SC) discusses and recommends C2SM's involvement in a Community Project at the proposal stage. This includes a suggestion on the approximate number of FTEs to be reserved for the project;
- The C2SM Executive Director (ED) forwards the information to the core team, and together with the responsible programmers evaluates the feasibility of the plans, taking into account all other ongoing activities and plans;
- The ED forwards the information back to the SC;
- The SC approves the plans and time allocated to the Community Project;
- The C2SM core team reserves the FTEs assuming the project will be funded;
- At the latest at the beginning of the project, the project steering group develops and formulates how it envisions the involvement of the core team and defines specific tasks. The tasks are submitted as a proposal to the C2SM ED and the involved programmers;
- The ED and the responsible programmer(s) evaluate the tasks, provide feedback/clarification, and finally submit their proposal to the C2SM SC;
- The SC approves the task list;
- The task assignment from Community Projects is repeated regularly, at semi-â€‹annual or annual intervals, ideally 1-2 months before the biannual Working Group Day.
