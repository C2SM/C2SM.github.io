# Tasks from C2SM Member Groups

## Procedure
1. **Submission:**
Tasks can be submitted as issues through our GitHub repository [Tasks-Support](https://github.com/C2SM/Tasks-Support) at any time. The task proposal must include a description and goals of the task, a time estimate, a statement of urgency, the groups involved, and at least one contact person. It should also describe the benefit to C2SM. Please follow the instructions for [Submit a Task](https://github.com/C2SM/Tasks-Support#submit-a-task).

2. **Evaluation:**
The Core Team will evaluate the proposals and may provide feedback/ask questions/reiterate the proposals to the groups. Priority will be given to tasks with greater benefit to multiple C2SM groups. Updates on the tasks will be given directly on the submitted task in the GitHub repository.

3. **Core Team starts working on task:**
Depending on the urgency or current workload of the Core Team, C2SM may begin work on the task immediately or at a later point in time.

4. **Feedback and Discussion of Tasks:**
During the semi-annual WG Day, to which representatives of each C2SM member group are invited, the status and future of submitted tasks are discussed. Members can provide critical feedback on the process.
