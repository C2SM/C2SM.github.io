# CESM
The Community Earth System Model (CESM) is a fully-coupled,
global climate model that provides state-of-the-art computer simulations of the Earth's past, 
present, and future climate states. For more info please see the [CESM Homepage](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/).

## Support
The current supported version on [ETH Cluster Euler](https://scicomp.ethz.ch/wiki/Main_Page) are **CESM 1.2.2** and **CESM 2.1.2**.
Newer CESM2 versions are supported by request. We recommend to use CESM2. Please contact [Urs Beyerle](https://usys.ethz.ch/personen/profil.NDk5MTg=.TGlzdC82MzcsMzIwMTk3MjIy.html) for support.

## Get started
* [Setup a CESM2 control run](https://wiki.iac.ethz.ch/Climphys/ProjectCESM2SetupControlRun) (ETH login required)
* [Setup a CESM1 control run](https://wiki.iac.ethz.ch/Climphys/ProjectCESM122SetupControlRun) (ETH login required)
